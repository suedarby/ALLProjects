                                        at sewing and a natural talent for pattern drafting "by the numbers". I only
                                        spent a year here, learned a lot and transferred to Solano due to finances.</p>

                                        from San Francisco depending on Bay Area traffic and time of day! It is a local
                                        community college and where I learned the art of pattern making by computer as
                                        well as a love of teaching computer skills. This was where I learned to draft in
                                        miniature, sew tiny, fine rolled hems on silk and a multitude of other skills.
                                        Sadly my instructor has retired and I've lost contact with her. You can see the
                                        results of my pattern skills and even some of my technical writing and computer
                                        skills at <a href="http://www.suestinycostumes.com">Sue's Tiny Costumes</a>.</p>
